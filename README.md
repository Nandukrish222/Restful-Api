# Restful-Api
Build A Restful Api With Node.js Express &amp; MongoDB
Hi there this a simple project that only takes atmost an 1hour to complete.
so before you start you need a basic understanding of mangodb and javascript and how to use it.
"THIS IS A NOTE FOR WHO EVER IS TRYING AND NOT ABLE TO RUN THE API THAT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO INSTALL PACKAGES SUCH AS-- JSON,NODEJS,BODY-PARSER,MONGOOSE,EXPRESS,NODEMON,DOTENV".
